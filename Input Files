Yelp dataset is a huge dataset with few GBs of data in it. github does not allow files more than 25MB in size. So We are unable to upload the input files. Either those files can be download directly from their website at 
https://www.yelp.com/dataset
Or, you may contact our group for the dataset. We will be happy to share the files.
